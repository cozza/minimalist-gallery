# Minimalist Gallery
This responsive minimalist gallery uses flexbox and modal. It also offers a light or dark theme. 

## Personalising
The code is fairly straight forward to personalise but just so you don't miss anything, these are the bits you should change:

`<title>Minimalist Gallery</title>` to whatever you wish to have as the title of the webpage.

`<div class="title">Name's Gallery</div>` this is the main (large) header text, change it to your name or brand.

`<p>A collection of Name's photography and artwork</p>` this is the text underneath the large header text, change to whatever you like.

`<a href="https://instagram.com/usernamehere"><i class="fa-brands fa-instagram"></i></a>` this is the start of the social media icons & links. Swap out for your own links. If you would like different social media icons shown, you can view other options at [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons) and swap, add or remove the `fa-instagram` as you see fit.

`<img class="image" alt="Insert your caption here" src="images/001.jpg" style="width:100%">` replace `"images/001.jpg"` etc. with "yourImageURL".

`&copy; Images belong to <a href="https://yourwebsite.com">Name</a>` this is the footer text. Replace the link with your own and amend it as you like!

Alternatively, I have made a [generator](https://coreycaird.com/generators/minimalist-gallery/) for those who would rather not manually edit the code themselves!
